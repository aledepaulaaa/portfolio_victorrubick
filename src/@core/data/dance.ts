            some music videos, such as Pablo
            Escobar from DubDogz, among
            other projects. His current research
            is focused on Freestyle within
            dance, focusing on the
            development of body awareness.
            His study follows an experimental
            line where the idea is not to stick
            to a specific style, but rather, with
            all the body baggage acquired, to
            create and develop his own
            language within dance.
