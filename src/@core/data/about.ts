        Born in 1996 in the city of Juiz De Fora - Minas Gerais, Victor Xavier Tolentino, also known as Rubick,
        has always been involved with art since he was a child. At the age of 7, he entered the world of music, starting to play the drums. 
        At the age of 13, he had his first contact with dance, which opened the way to a new world where he sought to dedicate himself and become
        a professional, going through groups, companies and crews, always passionate about the competitive environment. In 2019, he moved to Belo Horizonte,
        to work with dance, and fully dedicate himself to his goals, giving classes, studying dances, competing, etc.
        In addition to body movement, he has always loved technology, took web design courses as a teenager,
        started editing his own videos and carrying out small projects at the age of 15, but it was only in 2020 during the 
        pandemic that he began to awaken his true interest in visual effects (VFX). 
        Due to social distancing, he began to study, take courses and invest in this area, seeking knowledge of animation, special effects, 
        simulations and everything that encompasses CGI. 
        In 2023 he moved to the state of SÃ£o Paulo, in Araraquara, and currently works with VFX, combined with all his other artistic veins.
